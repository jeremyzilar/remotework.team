title: Consulting

I combine human-centered design and strategic business consulting to help artists and mission-driven art organizations to set visions, create strategies, design compelling experiences, and empower their teams to have greater autonomy, confidence, and independence.

I serve as an artistsâ€™ strategic design partner and guide by immersing myself in their unique rhythms, business operations, and artistic process.

I work with teams to improve the way they work by creating and implementing new physical and digital workflows, rhythms, and communication that better serve the goals of the artist and improve the quality and efficiency of artwork, products, brands, services and artistic environments.
