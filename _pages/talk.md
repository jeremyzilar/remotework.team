title: "Let's Talk"

If you're interested in finding out if I'd be the right fit for your team, [**schedule a free consult**](https://calendly.com/jeremyzilar/online).

Before we meet, it would be helpful for me to know more about:
- your team composition (size, skills, location, etc..)
- what role you play on the team
- some of the top problems you'd like to solve
- current goals or objectives

I often work with organizations that have teams in multiple locations, in different time zones and different countries.

**When we talk**, it's important that we communicate in a way that is comfortable to you and your team.

- **In-person meetings** — I prefer to meet in Manhattan, near the West Village or the World Trade Center building. [Schedule a consult »](https://calendly.com/jeremyzilar/in-person)
- **Online meetings** — I generally use [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/), [ZOOM](https://zoom.us/), or [WhereBy](https://whereby.com/), but am open to using other services. [Schedule a consult »](https://calendly.com/jeremyzilar/online)
- **Phone** — Sometimes the phone is the easiest. I am happy to provide my number after you schedule a time to meet. [Schedule a consult »](https://calendly.com/jeremyzilar/online)
- **Email** — [jeremyzilar@gmail.com](mailto:jeremyzilar@gmail.com)
